This report aimed to provide a discussion of findings during my term project. This is the first phase of my Master's thesis, therefore it mainly focused of theoretical discussion on the issue.

The research chapter\,\ref{chapter:research} listed and covered mathematical and engineering principles of construction of convolutional neural networks. It stumbled upon some drawbacks of such design and proposed available solutions.

List of available, existing implementation and available deep learning frameworks is provided as well. Fundamental benefits and advantages of each frameworks is listed in the following chapter\,\ref{chapter:solutions}. There you can find also a deeper look into one specific solution available on the marked\,--\,FaceNet\,\ref{ss:facenet}.

Later some available data sets are listed, including a short description of each, accompanied by basic metric. Large scale face databases are listed as well.

As being said, this term project is a first part of my Master's Thesis. Findings and research done will be utilized in the later part, which will cover actual design and implementation of an own solution to this problem. The theoretical background and knowledge research works covered in this report established basic layout and principles upon which the solution will be build.
