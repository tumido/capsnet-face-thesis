Thesis aimed to cover, explain and experiment with new approaches to facial recognition. The research chapter\,\ref{chapter:research} listed and covered mathematical and engineering principles of construction of convolutional neural networks. It stumbled upon some drawbacks of such design and proposed available solutions. It discusses convolutional neural networks as well as the newest capsule network approach. This throughout review of principles behind successful identification is later transformed into a state-of-the-art market scan, providing a quick insight into publicly available solutions as well as available frameworks. Fundamental benefits and advantages of each framework and solution is listed in the Chapter\,\ref{chapter:solutions}.

The very same chapter also provides an overview of available training data sets are listed, with focus on in-the-wild image data. This review includes a short description of each, accompanied by basic metric. Large scale face databases are listed as well.

This knowledge is later leveraged to create own implementation of a capsule network. The Chapter\,\ref{chapter:implementation} covers the actual design and implementation of this solution.
